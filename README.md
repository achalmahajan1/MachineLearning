# MachineLearning_Course by Andrew Ng (Stanford University)
This repository contains solution to the assignment problems for the course "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng, probably one of the most famous (and oldest) course offered in this field. It is available free of cost
, and I would recommend everyone to give it a shot.
## The first HW
involves implementing unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm to predict from the existing features based on batch gradient descent method (or Normal Eq.). The underlying 
algorithm essentially solves least square fitting between the training and linear regression data.
